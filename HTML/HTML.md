# HTML HYPERTEXT MARKUP LANGUAGE

HTML stands for **Hypertext Markup Language**. It is a fundamental **markup language** used to **structure and organize the content of web pages** on the internet. 

HTML uses a system of **markup tags** to **define the elements and their layout on a webpage**. These elements can include headings, paragraphs, images, links, forms, and more.

HTML is the foundational technology of the World Wide Web and is essential for building any website or web application. It provides a way to organize and present information to users across different devices and browsers.

It is important to note that **HTML is not a programming language but rather a markup language**. Unlike programming languages like JavaScript or Python, HTML does not have the ability to perform computations or control the behavior of a webpage. Instead, it **focuses on providing a semantic structure** to the content and describing how it should be presented.

Over time, HTML has evolved, and the latest version is HTML5. HTML5 introduces new elements and features that improve the semantic meaning of content, support multimedia, and enhance interactivity on web pages. It also supports responsive design principles, making it easier to create websites that adapt to different screen sizes and devices.

As a frontend developer, I use HTML5 extensively to create well-structured, accessible, and responsive web pages. I also ensure proper use of semantic elements to enhance search engine optimization and user experience.
