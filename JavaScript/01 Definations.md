# JAVASCRIPT

## JavaScript is a **lightweight interpreted** (or just-in-time compiled) programming language with first-class functions.

JavaScript is often described as "lightweight" because it's relatively easy to learn and use.

JavaScript is primarily an interpreted language, which means that **code written in JavaScript is executed line by line by an interpreter at runtime**. <br>
This is in contrast to compiled languages like C++ or Java, where code is translated into machine code before execution. JavaScript's interpreted nature allows for more flexibility but can sometimes lead to performance trade-offs.

Just-IN-TIME compiled means **portions of JavaScript code are compiled into machine code just before they are executed**, improving the performance of JavaScript applications.

First-Class Functions means that functions in JavaScript are treated as **first-class citizens**. In other words, **functions can be assigned to variables, passed as arguments to other functions, and returned as values from other functions**. <br>
This provides a lot of flexibility and power for working with functions in JavaScript, allowing you to create higher-order functions and build more modular and reusable code.

## JavaScript is a prototype-based, multi-paradigm, single-threaded, dynamic language, supporting object-oriented, imperative, and declarative (e.g. functional programming) styles.

**Proto-type** <br>
In JavaScript, **objects can inherit properties and methods from other objects through a mechanism called prototypes**. This allows for flexible and dynamic object creation and modification.

**Multi-Paradigm** <br>
JavaScript supports multiple programming paradigms, including **object-oriented** (using objects and classes), **imperative** (using statements and procedures), and **declarative** (functional programming, where you define what should be done rather than how).

**Single Threaded** <br>
JavaScript runs in a single execution thread, meaning **it processes one task at a time**. <br>
This can lead to potential blocking if tasks take a long time to complete, so developers often use asynchronous techniques to avoid this.

**Dynamic Language** <br>
JavaScript is **dynamically typed**, which means you **don't need to declare variable types explicitly**. Types are determined at runtime, providing flexibility but also potentially leading to runtime errors.

## JavaScript is a versatile scripting and programming language used to enhance web pages by adding dynamic and interactive elements 
such as real-time updates, interactive maps, animated graphics, video players, and more. <br>
It empowers web developers to create engaging and functional online experiences **beyond static content display**.
