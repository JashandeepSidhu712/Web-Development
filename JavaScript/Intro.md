# JAVASCRIPT
JavaScript is a **high-level, versatile, and dynamic programming language** primarily used for **building interactive and dynamic web applications**. 

It is an essential component of modern web development, enabling developers to **create features that enhance user experience, manipulate webpage content, and communicate with servers in real-time**. 

JavaScript is executed within web browsers, allowing it to **directly interact with HTML and CSS**, making web pages more dynamic by responding to user actions and events without requiring a full page reload. 

Additionally, JavaScript can also be used on the **server-side (Node.js) to build scalable and efficient network applications**. Its flexibility, wide adoption, and extensive ecosystem of libraries and frameworks make it a cornerstone of both front-end and back-end web development.
