## 1. Create New Folder in DropBox

## 2. Open Folder in VS Code

## 3. Create New Terminal

## 4. Run 'npm init -y'
command is a shortcut for **initializing a new Node.js project** using npm (Node Package Manager) with default settings. <br>
So, when you run npm init -y, it will **quickly generate a package.json file** in the current directory with default values.

## 5. Create 'server.js' in folder

## 6. Run 'npm install express'
command is used to **install the Express.js framework in a Node.js project**. 

Express.js is a popular web application framework for Node.js that simplifies the process of building web applications and APIs.

When you run this command, npm will fetch the Express package from the npm registry and install it in your project's **node_modules directory**. 

Additionally, it will update the dependencies section of your project's package.json file to include Express as a dependency.
